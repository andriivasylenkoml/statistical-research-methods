Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarizes data using indexes such as mean and median and another is inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data using statistical tests such as student's t-test.

## An Introduction to t Tests
A t test is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups. It is often used in hypothesis testing to determine whether a process or treatment actually has an effect on the population of interest, or whether two groups are different from one another.

> **t test example**
>
>You want to know whether the mean petal length of iris flowers differs according to their species. You find two different species of irises growing in a garden and measure 25 petals of each species. You can test the difference between these two groups using a t test and null and alternative hypotheses.
>- The null hypothesis (H0) is that the true difference between these group means is zero.
>- The alternate hypothesis (Ha) is that the true difference is different from zero.
